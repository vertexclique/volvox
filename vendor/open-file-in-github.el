;;; Commentary:

;; Opens the GitHub page for the current file in a browser
;; use M-x open-file-in-github to simply open the file
;; use M-x open-file-in-github-line-highlighted to open it with the current line highlighted
;; use M-x open-file-in-github-region-highlighted to open it with the current region highlighted
